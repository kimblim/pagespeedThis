pagespeedThis
=============

A very simple bookmarklet that analyses the pagespeed of the current page in the browser

## Code

```javascript
javascript:window.location='https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url='+encodeURI(window.location);
```

## Install
For now it's a bit tedious — create a HTML-page containing a link with the code mentioned above in the href, visit that page and then drag the link to your bookmarks-folder / bar. 


## Usage
Visit a page, click the bookmarklet. It's that simple, and that's the reason I was able to make it. 

## To-do
* Improve documentation — if anyone has a good idea on how to incorporate the actual bookmarklet in markdown, I'm all ears :)

## License

Please do with it what you want — if you have any ideas or improvements to the code (by all means: I'm no genius, so there's a huge chance that your code is better than mine) do a pull request or hit me at Twitter: @therealkimblim
